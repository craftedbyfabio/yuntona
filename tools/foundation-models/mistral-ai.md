# Mistral AI

European foundation models and agents. EU data sovereignty alternative to US providers.

## What It Does

A European AI company building foundation models and agent capabilities. Offers both API access and open-weight models, positioning as the EU data sovereignty alternative to US AI providers.

## Security Relevance

Mistral's European headquarters and EU data processing provide a sovereignty alternative for organisations concerned about US cloud provider data access. Their open-weight models can also be self-hosted for complete data control.

## When to Use It

Evaluate when EU data sovereignty is a requirement. API access is straightforward (Guided Setup), but self-hosted deployment of larger models requires GPU infrastructure. The sovereignty story is Mistral's key differentiator for security-conscious European organisations.
