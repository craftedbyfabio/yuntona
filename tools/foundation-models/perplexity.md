# Perplexity

Conversational web search using multiple LLMs. Enterprise shadow AI risk vector.

## What It Does

A conversational web search engine powered by multiple LLMs. Provides sourced, cited answers to queries by searching the web and synthesising results in real-time.

## Security Relevance

Perplexity is a shadow AI risk vector — employees using it for research may inadvertently share sensitive query context with external AI services. Unlike traditional search engines, Perplexity processes and reasons about query context, potentially exposing more information than a simple search query would.

## When to Use It

Monitor for shadow AI usage in your organisation. Perplexity itself is a browser-based tool with zero setup — the security concern is governance and awareness rather than technical controls.
