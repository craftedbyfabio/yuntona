# Wiz

Cloud security platform with AI-SPM features for securing AI workloads in cloud.

## What It Does

The leading Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) with AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM) capabilities. Provides agentless cloud security with specific features for discovering and securing AI workloads in cloud environments.

## Security Relevance

Wiz's AI-SPM features discover AI workloads across your cloud environment — model training jobs, serving endpoints, data pipelines — and assess their security posture. This gives security teams visibility into AI infrastructure they may not know exists, including shadow AI deployments.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need cloud security coverage that includes AI workload discovery and assessment. Enterprise CNAPP requiring procurement, cloud account integration, and organisation-wide deployment. Most valuable for multi-cloud environments with distributed AI workloads.
