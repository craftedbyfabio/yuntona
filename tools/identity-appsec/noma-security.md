# Noma Security

End-to-end AI application security platform. Covers the full AI development lifecycle with posture management.

## What It Does

An end-to-end AI application security platform providing AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM). Covers the full AI development lifecycle from data preparation through production monitoring, with visibility into model risks, data flows, and security posture.

## Security Relevance

Noma provides the broadest coverage of any AI security platform — spanning all 10 OWASP LLM risks across all lifecycle stages. Their AI-SPM approach gives security teams a single pane of glass for understanding AI risk across the organisation.

## When to Use It

Evaluate when you need comprehensive AI security coverage from a single platform. Enterprise procurement with org-wide deployment across AI development teams and infrastructure. This is a platform commitment, not a point tool.
