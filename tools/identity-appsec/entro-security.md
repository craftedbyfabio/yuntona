# Entro Security

Non-Human Identity Management. Discovers and secures machine identities and secrets.

## What It Does

A Non-Human Identity Management platform that discovers and secures machine identities and secrets across enterprise infrastructure. Provides visibility into the full lifecycle of non-human credentials — from creation to rotation to decommissioning.

## Security Relevance

AI systems generate a proliferation of non-human identities — API keys, service accounts, OAuth tokens, certificates — that are often unmanaged and over-privileged. Entro discovers these identities, assesses their risk, and provides lifecycle management to prevent credential-based attacks.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need visibility and governance over the non-human identities in your AI infrastructure. Enterprise platform requiring procurement, infrastructure discovery, and integration with identity providers and secret managers.
