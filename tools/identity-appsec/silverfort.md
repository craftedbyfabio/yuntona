# Silverfort

Unified Identity Protection platform with MFA for service accounts and AI workloads.

## What It Does

A Unified Identity Protection platform that extends MFA and adaptive authentication to resources that traditionally can't support it — including service accounts, legacy applications, and AI workloads.

## Security Relevance

Service accounts and machine identities used by AI systems are often the weakest link — they can't do MFA, they have static passwords, and they're over-privileged. Silverfort applies adaptive authentication and risk-based access controls to these identities without modifying the underlying systems.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need to secure service accounts and machine identities used by AI infrastructure. Enterprise platform requiring procurement, Active Directory integration, and organisation-wide policy deployment.
