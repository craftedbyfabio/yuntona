# AppOmni

SaaS Security Posture Management — visibility into AI SaaS configurations and data flows.

## What It Does

A SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) platform providing visibility into AI-related SaaS configurations and data flows. Monitors how AI features in SaaS applications are configured and what data they can access.

## Security Relevance

As SaaS vendors embed AI features into their products, new data exposure risks emerge. AppOmni monitors these AI configurations — are AI features enabled? What data can they access? Are data sharing settings appropriate? This catches misconfigurations that traditional CASB tools miss.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need visibility into AI features across your SaaS portfolio. Enterprise SSPM requiring procurement, SaaS integrations, and ongoing configuration monitoring. Most valuable for organisations with large SaaS estates adopting AI features.
