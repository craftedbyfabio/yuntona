# BitSight

AI-powered cyber risk intelligence across attack surface and third-party ecosystem.

## What It Does

An AI-powered cyber risk intelligence platform providing security ratings, attack surface management, and continuous monitoring across your third-party ecosystem. Uses data-driven models to quantify cyber risk.

## Security Relevance

BitSight's AI-powered risk quantification is increasingly relevant as organisations assess AI vendors. Understanding a vendor's security posture before giving them access to training data or model endpoints is critical for AI supply chain governance.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need continuous third-party risk monitoring at enterprise scale. Procurement process with vendor portfolio integration. Most valuable for organisations managing large vendor ecosystems that include AI service providers.
