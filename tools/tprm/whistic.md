# Whistic

Modernize TPRM with automated assessments, vendor insights, and continuous risk monitoring.

## What It Does

A TPRM platform focused on modernising vendor risk assessments through automated questionnaires, vendor insights network, and continuous monitoring. Integrates with RiskRecon for combined ratings and assessment data.

## Security Relevance

Whistic's vendor network approach is relevant for AI vendor assessment — if an AI vendor already has a Whistic profile, you can access pre-completed assessment data rather than starting from scratch, significantly accelerating the evaluation process.

## When to Use It

Use when you need to streamline vendor security assessments with network-based data sharing. SaaS with vendor profile setup, assessment configuration, and monitoring.
