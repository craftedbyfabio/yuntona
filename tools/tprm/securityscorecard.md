# SecurityScorecard

Supply Chain Detection and Response (SCDR) connecting TPRM and SOC teams.

## What It Does

A Supply Chain Detection and Response (SCDR) platform that connects TPRM and SOC teams. Provides security ratings, continuous monitoring, and incident response workflows for third-party risk.

## Security Relevance

SecurityScorecard's SCDR approach is relevant for AI supply chain incidents — when an AI vendor is breached or a model supply chain is compromised, you need to quickly assess impact across your vendor portfolio and coordinate response.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need enterprise TPRM with SOC integration for incident response. Enterprise platform requiring procurement and vendor portfolio integration.
