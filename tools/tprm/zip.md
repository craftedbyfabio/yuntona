# Zip

Agentic procurement orchestration platform — AI-native intake to PO.

## What It Does

An agentic procurement orchestration platform providing AI-native intake-to-PO workflows. Uses AI agents to automate procurement processes from initial request through purchase order.

## Security Relevance

Zip represents the emerging category of AI-native procurement — where AI agents handle parts of the procurement workflow. This creates both opportunity (faster vendor assessment) and risk (AI agents making procurement decisions need governance controls).

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need AI-powered procurement automation. Enterprise platform requiring procurement process redesign and organisation-wide rollout.
