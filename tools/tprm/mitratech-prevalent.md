# Mitratech Prevalent

End-to-end TPRM for every stage of the vendor lifecycle.

## What It Does

An end-to-end Third-Party Risk Management platform covering every stage of the vendor lifecycle. Provides risk assessments, compliance monitoring, and remediation workflows for managing vendor relationships.

## Security Relevance

Prevalent's lifecycle approach is relevant as AI vendor relationships require ongoing monitoring — not just initial assessment. Model updates, data handling changes, and new AI features all affect risk posture and need continuous evaluation.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need comprehensive TPRM coverage across the full vendor lifecycle. Enterprise platform requiring procurement, vendor portfolio migration, and process redesign.
