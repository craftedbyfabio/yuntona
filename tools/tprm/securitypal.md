# SecurityPal

100x faster security reviews powered by AI Agents and expert humans.

## What It Does

A platform combining AI agents with human security experts to deliver faster security reviews. The AI handles routine questionnaire completion while humans review complex or sensitive responses.

## Security Relevance

The hybrid AI-plus-human approach is particularly relevant for AI security questionnaires, where some questions have standard answers (encryption in transit, SOC2 compliance) while others require nuanced, context-specific responses about AI governance and model security.

## When to Use It

Use when you need to scale security review capacity without sacrificing quality on complex AI security questions. SaaS with content upload and workflow configuration.
