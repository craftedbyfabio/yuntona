# Drata

Trust centre with Compliance as Code and AI Questionnaire Assistance. Acquired SafeBase.

## What It Does

An enterprise compliance automation platform providing continuous evidence collection, trust centres, and AI-assisted questionnaire completion. Acquired SafeBase to expand trust centre capabilities. Supports SOC2, ISO 27001, and emerging AI governance frameworks.

## Security Relevance

Drata's compliance automation is increasingly relevant as AI governance frameworks (ISO 42001, EU AI Act) require auditable evidence. Automated evidence collection reduces the manual burden of demonstrating AI compliance, while the trust centre communicates your AI security posture to customers.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need automated compliance evidence collection and trust centre capabilities. Enterprise platform requiring procurement, integration with 100+ tools, and organisation-wide adoption. Most valuable when pursuing AI-specific certifications.
