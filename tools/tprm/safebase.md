# SafeBase

Trust Center + AI Questionnaire Assistance.

## What It Does

A trust centre platform (now part of Drata) that provides a public-facing portal for sharing security documentation, certifications, and compliance status with customers and partners.

## Security Relevance

As customers increasingly ask about AI security practices, a trust centre provides a scalable way to communicate your AI governance posture. Self-service access to AI-related security documentation reduces the volume of ad-hoc security questionnaires.

## When to Use It

Use when you need a customer-facing portal for AI security documentation. SaaS with content upload, branding, and access management setup.
