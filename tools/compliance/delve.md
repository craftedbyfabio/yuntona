# Delve

Compliance automation via AI agent that integrates directly into your tech stack for evidence gathering.

## What It Does

A compliance automation platform that uses AI agents to integrate directly into your tech stack for evidence gathering. The AI-first approach means evidence collection is more automated and less dependent on manual processes.

## Security Relevance

Delve's AI agent approach to evidence collection is particularly relevant for AI governance — the agent can discover and document AI workloads, model configurations, and security controls across your infrastructure automatically.

## When to Use It

Use when you want AI-automated evidence collection for compliance. Requires integration with your tech stack and evidence configuration. The AI agent approach reduces setup time compared to traditional integration-based tools.
