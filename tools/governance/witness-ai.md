# Witness.ai

Enterprise AI safety platform providing visibility and policy enforcement for shadow AI.

## What It Does

An enterprise AI safety platform that provides visibility and policy enforcement for shadow AI usage across the organisation. Monitors employee interactions with AI tools and enforces data protection policies in real-time.

## Security Relevance

Shadow AI is one of the most immediate risks for enterprises — employees using ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools with sensitive data, bypassing security controls. Witness.ai provides visibility into this usage and enforcement of data protection policies without blocking productivity.

## When to Use It

Deploy when shadow AI is an identified risk and you need both visibility and policy enforcement. Enterprise platform requiring procurement, org-wide deployment, and policy configuration. Most valuable in regulated industries with strict data handling requirements.
