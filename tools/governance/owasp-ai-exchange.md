# OWASP AI Exchange

The comprehensive open-source guide to AI security — the definitive reference.

## What It Does

The comprehensive open-source guide to AI security maintained by OWASP. Covers threats, controls, and governance across the entire AI lifecycle. The definitive reference for understanding the AI threat landscape.

## Security Relevance

This is the single most important reference document in AI security. It maps threats across all 10 LLM risks, provides control recommendations, and connects to the broader OWASP ecosystem. If you read one resource, make it this one.

## When to Use It

Use as your foundational reference when building AI security programmes, writing policies, or assessing risks. Consult it when mapping controls to specific threats. Updated regularly by the OWASP community.
