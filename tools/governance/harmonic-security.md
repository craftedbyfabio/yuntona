# Harmonic Security

Data protection platform that detects and governs Shadow AI usage across the enterprise.

## What It Does

A data protection platform specifically designed for governing Shadow AI usage in enterprises. Detects AI tool usage, classifies data being shared with AI services, and enforces data loss prevention policies across AI interactions.

## Security Relevance

Addresses the DLP gap that traditional tools miss — data leaving through AI chat interfaces, API calls to LLM providers, and embedded AI features in productivity tools. Harmonic tracks what data goes where and enforces policies to prevent sensitive information from reaching external AI services.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need enterprise-wide DLP specifically for AI channels. Procurement, integration with existing DLP infrastructure, and organisation-wide rollout are required. Complements traditional DLP rather than replacing it.
