# OWASP GenAI Solutions

OWASP Solutions Landscape directory for AI security vendors.

## What It Does

OWASP's curated Solutions Landscape directory mapping AI security vendors and tools to specific GenAI security use cases. Part of the broader OWASP GenAI Security Project.

## Security Relevance

Provides an OWASP-endorsed view of the vendor landscape, helping teams identify solutions that map to specific OWASP risks. Useful as a cross-reference when evaluating tools — if a vendor appears in both Yuntona and the OWASP directory, that's a stronger signal.

## When to Use It

Use when evaluating vendors to cross-reference against OWASP's own assessment. Helpful for procurement justification — being listed in an OWASP directory carries weight with auditors and compliance teams.
