# NIST AI RMF Maturity Model

Framework for assessing AI risk maturity based on NIST standards.

## What It Does

A framework for assessing organisational maturity in AI risk management, based on NIST's AI Risk Management Framework. Provides a structured approach to measuring and improving AI governance capabilities across multiple dimensions.

## Security Relevance

Maps AI risk management capabilities to maturity levels, helping organisations understand where they stand and what to prioritise. Useful for building a roadmap from ad-hoc AI usage to structured AI governance, with clear milestones along the way.

## When to Use It

Use when building an AI governance roadmap or assessing current maturity for leadership reporting. Requires mapping to your organisation's specific processes and capabilities — not just reading the framework but applying it to your context.
