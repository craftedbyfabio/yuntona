# Identity Defined Security Alliance

Non-profit framework for identity-centric security strategies.

## What It Does

A non-profit organisation providing frameworks and best practices for identity-centric security strategies. Publishes guidance on implementing identity-first security models across enterprise infrastructure.

## Security Relevance

As AI agents proliferate, identity becomes the critical security control — every agent needs an identity, every API call needs authentication, every tool invocation needs authorisation. IDSA's frameworks for identity-centric security directly apply to securing AI agent permissions and workload identities.

## When to Use It

Reference when designing identity architectures for AI systems, particularly when AI agents need to authenticate to services and APIs. The frameworks provide a structured approach to thinking about non-human identity in AI deployments.
