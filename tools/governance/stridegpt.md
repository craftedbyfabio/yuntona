# StrideGPT

AI-powered threat modeling tool. Uses LLMs to generate context-specific security requirements.

## What It Does

An AI-powered threat modelling tool that uses LLMs to generate context-specific security requirements, threats, and mitigations. Applies the STRIDE methodology (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to AI systems.

## Security Relevance

Accelerates threat modelling by using AI to generate initial threat assessments, attack trees, and mitigation recommendations. Particularly useful for security teams that need to threat model AI applications but lack deep AI security expertise — the tool provides a structured starting point.

## When to Use It

Use at the design phase of AI projects to generate initial threat models. Web-based and straightforward to use. The output should be reviewed and refined by a security architect, but it dramatically reduces the time to a first-pass threat model.
