# Zenity

Governance and security for Low-Code/No-Code AI agents and copilots.

## What It Does

A governance and security platform for Low-Code/No-Code AI agents and copilots. Provides visibility, risk assessment, and policy enforcement for AI-powered automations built by business users rather than developers.

## Security Relevance

The Low-Code/No-Code AI explosion means business users are building AI agents without security review. Zenity provides governance for this shadow development — discovering AI automations, assessing their risk, and enforcing policies without blocking citizen developer productivity.

## When to Use It

Deploy when business users are building AI-powered automations in platforms like Power Platform, Zapier, or custom copilots. Enterprise platform requiring procurement and integration with your Low-Code/No-Code ecosystem.
