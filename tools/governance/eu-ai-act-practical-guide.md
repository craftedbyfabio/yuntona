# EU AI Act Practical Guide

Legal framework guide for navigating European AI regulations.

## What It Does

A practical legal guide by Cuatrecasas for navigating the European AI regulation. Breaks down the EU AI Act's risk classification system, prohibited practices, transparency requirements, and compliance obligations into actionable guidance.

## Security Relevance

The EU AI Act is the most comprehensive AI regulation globally and will affect any organisation deploying AI in European markets. Understanding the risk classification system (unacceptable, high, limited, minimal risk) is essential for determining what security and governance controls are legally required.

## When to Use It

Read when your organisation deploys AI systems that affect EU citizens or operates in European markets. Essential background for GRC teams building AI compliance programmes. The guide makes the dense regulation accessible without requiring legal expertise.
