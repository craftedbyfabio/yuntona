# ETSI AI Security Standard

World-leading standard (TS 104 223) for securing AI systems.

## What It Does

The European Telecommunications Standards Institute's standard (TS 104 223) for securing AI systems. One of the first formal technical standards specifically addressing AI security requirements.

## Security Relevance

Provides prescriptive technical requirements for AI security rather than just principles. Covers secure development, deployment, and operation of AI systems with specific controls. Particularly relevant for organisations operating in European markets or regulated industries.

## When to Use It

Adopt when building AI systems for European markets or regulated sectors. The standard complements ISO 42001 (management system) with technical security requirements. Enterprise-level commitment requiring process changes and potentially external assessment.
