# ISO/IEC 42001

The global standard for AI Management Systems.

## What It Does

The global standard for AI Management Systems, published by ISO/IEC. Specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an AI management system within organisations.

## Security Relevance

ISO 42001 is becoming the gold standard for demonstrating AI governance maturity. It provides a structured framework for managing AI risks, similar to how ISO 27001 frames information security. Certification demonstrates to customers, regulators, and partners that your AI practices meet international standards.

## When to Use It

Pursue when your organisation needs to demonstrate AI governance maturity to enterprise customers, regulators, or partners. This is an organisational commitment requiring cross-functional implementation, internal audit capability, and ongoing maintenance. Plan for 6-12 months minimum.
