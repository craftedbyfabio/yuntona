# Cisco AI Runtime

Enterprise LLM firewall + guardrails. Prevents prompt injection, data loss, and compliance violations at scale.

## What It Does

Cisco's enterprise AI security solution providing LLM firewall capabilities, guardrails, and compliance enforcement at scale. Part of Cisco's broader AI Defense portfolio, it integrates with existing Cisco network and security infrastructure.

## Security Relevance

Provides enterprise-grade AI security that integrates with the network layer — meaning it can enforce policies across all AI traffic traversing your infrastructure, not just specific applications. Covers prompt injection prevention, data loss prevention, and compliance policy enforcement.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need organisation-wide AI security enforcement integrated with existing Cisco infrastructure. Enterprise procurement, network integration, and policy management required. Best suited for organisations already in the Cisco ecosystem.
