# F5 AI Gateway

Network-layer AI security gateway. Protects, accelerates, and observes AI-powered applications.

## What It Does

F5's network-layer AI security gateway that protects, accelerates, and observes AI-powered applications. Sits in the network path between users and AI services, providing security scanning, rate limiting, and observability.

## Security Relevance

Network-layer enforcement means F5 AI Gateway can protect AI applications regardless of their implementation. It catches threats at the network boundary — prompt injection in HTTP payloads, data exfiltration in responses, and model theft through excessive API usage (LLM10).

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need network-level AI security enforcement across multiple AI applications. Enterprise network appliance requiring procurement, infrastructure integration, and network architecture changes. Best suited for organisations already using F5 infrastructure.
