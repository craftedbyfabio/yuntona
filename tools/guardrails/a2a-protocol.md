# A2A Protocol

Agent-to-Agent protocol standards. Defines how AI agents communicate — critical for security boundaries.

## What It Does

The Agent-to-Agent protocol standard that defines how AI agents communicate, authenticate, and collaborate. Specifies the message formats, security boundaries, and trust models for multi-agent systems.

## Security Relevance

As multi-agent systems proliferate, the communication layer between agents becomes a critical attack surface. A2A Protocol defines how agents establish trust, authenticate requests, and maintain security boundaries — preventing one compromised agent from manipulating others.

## When to Use It

Implement when building multi-agent systems where agents need to communicate securely. Requires protocol implementation, identity management, and security boundary design. Expert-level architecture work but essential for any production multi-agent deployment.
