# Pangea

Developer-first AI security APIs: Sanitize, Redact, Auth, Data Guard, Prompt Guard. Security-as-a-service for AI apps.

## What It Does

A developer-first platform providing security-as-a-service APIs for AI applications. Offers Prompt Guard (injection detection), AI Guard (content filtering), Redact (PII removal), Secure Audit Log, and authentication services — all as simple API calls.

## Security Relevance

Pangea lowers the barrier to implementing AI security by providing production-ready security capabilities as APIs. Instead of building your own PII redaction or prompt injection detection, you make an API call. This is particularly valuable for development teams that need security controls but lack security engineering expertise.

## When to Use It

Use when you want to add security capabilities to AI applications without building them from scratch. API-first approach means integration is straightforward — configure API keys, select services, integrate SDK calls. Days rather than weeks to deploy.
