# ZenGuard AI

Dev-first API platform for lowest-latency GenAI guardrails and vulnerability testing.

## What It Does

A developer-first API platform providing low-latency GenAI guardrails and vulnerability testing. Focuses on delivering the fastest possible guardrail response times to minimise impact on user experience.

## Security Relevance

Latency is the practical barrier to guardrail adoption — if your security scanning adds noticeable delay, developers will bypass it. ZenGuard AI optimises for speed, making it feasible to add guardrails to latency-sensitive applications like chatbots and real-time assistants.

## When to Use It

Use when latency is a critical requirement for your guardrail deployment. API-based integration with SDK support. Guided setup similar to Pangea — configure API keys, select guardrails, integrate into your application.
