# AIVSS

AI Vulnerability Scoring System for standardised AI risk rating.

## What It Does

The AI Vulnerability Scoring System — a web-based calculator that provides standardised risk ratings for AI-specific vulnerabilities, similar to how CVSS scores traditional software vulnerabilities.

## Security Relevance

Brings much-needed standardisation to AI vulnerability assessment. Without a common scoring framework, teams struggle to prioritise AI security findings consistently. AIVSS provides a structured approach to rating severity across dimensions specific to AI systems.

## When to Use It

Use when you need to communicate AI vulnerability severity to stakeholders in a standardised way. Particularly useful for GRC teams building AI risk registers who need consistent scoring across different types of AI findings.
