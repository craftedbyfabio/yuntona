# XM Cyber

Breach and Attack Simulation — maps attack paths across hybrid infrastructure including AI workloads.

## What It Does

An enterprise Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) platform that continuously maps attack paths across hybrid infrastructure. Models how an attacker could move laterally through networks, including paths that traverse AI workloads and ML infrastructure.

## Security Relevance

XM Cyber's value for AI security is in understanding how AI infrastructure fits into the broader attack surface. ML training pipelines, model serving endpoints, and data stores create new lateral movement paths that traditional vulnerability scanning misses.

## When to Use It

Use when you need to understand how AI infrastructure affects your overall attack surface. Enterprise deployment requiring procurement, network access, and agent installation across infrastructure. Not an AI-specific tool, but increasingly relevant as AI workloads expand.
