# Adversa AI

Red teaming platform for LLMs with automated benchmarking. Covers prompt injection and agentic threats.

## What It Does

A red teaming platform for LLMs with automated benchmarking and adversarial testing capabilities. Covers prompt injection, data extraction, jailbreaking, and increasingly agentic AI threats.

## Security Relevance

Adversa AI provides structured red teaming with benchmarking — meaning you get not just vulnerability findings but comparative scores against baseline safety metrics. Their coverage of agentic threats is notable as most tools haven't caught up to agent-specific attack vectors yet.

## When to Use It

Use when you need both red teaming findings and benchmark scores for reporting to leadership. The agentic coverage makes it relevant for teams deploying AI agents. SaaS platform with guided setup — lower barrier than self-hosted alternatives.
