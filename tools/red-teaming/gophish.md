# GoPhish

Open-source phishing toolkit. Relevant for testing AI-generated phishing campaigns.

## What It Does

An open-source phishing simulation toolkit for running controlled social engineering campaigns. Provides campaign management, email template creation, landing page cloning, and results tracking.

## Security Relevance

Relevant to AI security because LLMs are transforming phishing attacks — generating more convincing, personalised, and scalable social engineering content. GoPhish lets you test whether your organisation can detect AI-generated phishing, and whether your AI-powered email security actually catches sophisticated campaigns.

## When to Use It

Use when testing your organisation's resilience against AI-enhanced phishing attacks. Requires a mail server, careful scoping, and offensive security expertise. Always get written authorisation before running campaigns.
