# HexStrike

Advanced AI red teaming platform for LLM vulnerabilities.

## What It Does

A SaaS red teaming platform purpose-built for testing LLM vulnerabilities. Provides structured adversarial testing workflows with automated attack generation and results tracking.

## Security Relevance

Covers prompt injection, data leakage, and output manipulation testing in a managed environment. The platform approach means you get consistent, repeatable tests rather than ad-hoc manual probing — critical for demonstrating coverage to auditors.

## When to Use It

Use when you need structured, repeatable red team engagements against LLM-powered applications. Best suited for teams that want a managed platform rather than building their own testing harness from open-source tools.
