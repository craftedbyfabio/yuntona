# SoftwareAnalyst.io

Automated software analysis tool. Verify code privacy policies before use.

## What It Does

A web-based automated software analysis tool that provides code review, architecture analysis, and security scanning capabilities for software projects.

## Security Relevance

Verify the tool's code privacy policies before uploading proprietary code. Web-based analysis tools process code externally, which may conflict with data classification requirements. Understand what data is retained and how it's used.

## When to Use It

Use for initial code analysis when the privacy implications are acceptable. Web-based with minimal setup. Always review the data handling policies before uploading sensitive or proprietary code.
