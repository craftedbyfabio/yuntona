# Tabby

Self-hosted AI coding assistant. Open-source alternative for data sovereignty requirements.

## What It Does

A self-hosted open-source AI coding assistant. Runs entirely on your infrastructure with your choice of model, providing code completion and chat without any data leaving your environment.

## Security Relevance

Complete data sovereignty — everything runs on your hardware with your chosen model. No external API calls, no data transmission, no third-party processing. The strongest privacy guarantee available for AI code assistance, but comes with the operational burden of self-hosting.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you require air-gapped or fully sovereign AI code assistance. Requires GPU server provisioning, model selection and download, deployment configuration, and ongoing maintenance. Expert-level infrastructure work but the only option for truly air-gapped environments.
