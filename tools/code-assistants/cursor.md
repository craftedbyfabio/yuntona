# Cursor

AI-native code editor. Same governance implications as Copilot for proprietary code.

## What It Does

An AI-native code editor built on VS Code with deep model integration. Provides code completion, multi-file editing, codebase-aware chat, and increasingly autonomous coding capabilities. Same underlying technology concerns as GitHub Copilot.

## Security Relevance

Same governance implications as Copilot — proprietary code exposure to external models, generated code quality and security, and shadow AI risk if developers adopt it without approval. Cursor's codebase indexing means it may process more code context than simpler assistants.

## When to Use It

Govern the same way as Copilot. If developers are using Cursor, ensure governance policies address code classification, model provider selection, and review requirements. Desktop application requiring installation, subscription, and governance policy compliance.
