# Tabnine

AI code assistant with enterprise focus — private models, no code leaves your environment.

## What It Does

An AI code assistant with an enterprise focus, offering private models that can be trained on your codebase without data leaving your environment. Provides code completion and chat with strict data privacy guarantees.

## Security Relevance

Tabnine's differentiator is the privacy-first architecture — enterprise versions train private models on your code without sending data to external providers. This addresses the core LLM06 concern that makes other code assistants risky for sensitive codebases.

## When to Use It

Evaluate when you need AI code assistance but cannot send code to external providers. Enterprise configuration includes admin controls, model privacy settings, and compliance features. Guided setup for the IDE extension, but enterprise deployment requires admin configuration.
