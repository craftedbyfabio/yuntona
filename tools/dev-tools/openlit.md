# OpenLIT

OpenTelemetry-native LLM observability — one-line integration for cost, token, and prompt tracking.

## What It Does

An OpenTelemetry-native LLM observability solution that provides one-line integration for tracking costs, tokens, prompts, and performance metrics. Built on the OTEL standard for seamless integration with existing observability stacks.

## Security Relevance

If your organisation already uses OpenTelemetry for application observability, OpenLIT extends that investment to AI workloads. Security teams can monitor AI metrics alongside application metrics in the same dashboards, making it easier to correlate AI anomalies with broader system events.

## When to Use It

Use when you have an existing OTEL-based observability stack and want to add LLM monitoring. One-line integration is genuinely quick, but you need the OTEL infrastructure already in place. Natural fit for teams with mature observability practices.
