# OTEL OpenLit Demo

OpenTelemetry demo for LLM metrics observability.

## What It Does

A demonstration repository showing how to implement OpenTelemetry-based LLM metrics observability using OpenLIT. Provides a working reference implementation with Docker Compose setup.

## Security Relevance

Serves as a practical reference for teams wanting to implement LLM observability with OTEL. The demo shows exactly how to instrument AI applications, configure collectors, and visualise LLM metrics — reducing the guesswork of setting up observability from scratch.

## When to Use It

Use as a starting point when implementing OTEL-based LLM observability. Clone the repo, run Docker Compose, and explore. Educational resource that accelerates your own implementation.
