# Langfuse

Open-source LLM observability — traces, evals, prompt management. Critical audit trail for AI systems.

## What It Does

An open-source LLM observability platform providing traces, evaluations, and prompt management. Captures every LLM interaction — prompts, completions, latency, costs, and scores — creating a complete audit trail for AI systems.

## Security Relevance

Observability is the foundation of AI security monitoring. Without traces, you can't detect prompt injection attempts, data leakage, or anomalous model behaviour. Langfuse provides the audit trail that security teams need to investigate incidents and demonstrate compliance.

## When to Use It

Deploy when you need observability and audit trails for LLM applications. SDK integration is straightforward — add tracing calls to your application code. Self-hosted or cloud options. Essential infrastructure for any AI security monitoring programme.
