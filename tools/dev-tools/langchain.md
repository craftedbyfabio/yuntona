# LangChain

LLM orchestration framework for building AI agents and chains. Core infrastructure every security team must understand.

## What It Does

The dominant LLM orchestration framework for building AI agents and chains. Provides abstractions for connecting LLMs to tools, data sources, memory, and other components. Core infrastructure that a huge portion of AI applications are built on.

## Security Relevance

Every security team needs to understand LangChain because a large percentage of the AI applications they'll assess are built with it. Understanding LangChain's chain architecture, tool binding mechanisms, and memory patterns is essential for identifying where security controls should be applied.

## When to Use It

Study when you need to understand how AI applications are built — this is foundational knowledge for AI security assessments. Using LangChain to build requires framework-level commitment: architectural decisions, ongoing maintenance, and keeping up with rapid API changes.
