# BlackIce (Databricks)

Containerized red teaming toolkit for AI security testing.

## What It Does

A containerised red teaming toolkit from Databricks designed for AI security testing. Ships as Docker containers with pre-configured testing environments and attack tooling.

## Security Relevance

The containerised approach ensures reproducible test environments — critical when you need to demonstrate consistent findings across engagements. Integrates with Databricks' ML ecosystem but can be used standalone against any LLM endpoint.

## When to Use It

Use when you need isolated, reproducible red team environments, particularly in regulated industries where test environment consistency matters. Requires Docker knowledge and red team experience.
